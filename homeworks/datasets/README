This directory has datasets used in programming assignments for the course
STATS 607A taught at the University of Michigan.

seeds_dataset.txt
=================
This is a UCI dataset obtained from:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00236/seeds_dataset.txt
 
seeds_dataset_shuffled.txt
==========================
This is the same as seeds_dataset except that the data has been randomly shuffled
so that the examples in the same class are no longer contiguous.

example_index and example_arcs
==============================
This is a small webgraph obtained from:
http://webdatacommons.org/hyperlinkgraph/
There are 106 vertices and 141 directed edges

ionosphere.data
===============
This is a UCI datset obtained from:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/ionosphere/

tracy-widom.csv
===============
This isn't really a dataset. Since there's no built-in function in
Python/numpy/scipy that can evaluate the Tracy-Widom distribution's density, I
dumped the numerical values of the density function in this csv file. The
arguments are given in decreasing order and range from 5 through -8 in steps of
0.005. The numerical values were calculated in MATLAB using Algorithm 2 in:
